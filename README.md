# Anki
Some code for creating Anki flashcards.

Make shure Anki is installed and currently running on your machine.
You also need to install the extension [anki connect](https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect)

The "test your understanding.txt" questions are from the Machine Learning 2023 course by Prof. Dr. Rainer Gemulla and Tutor Tommaso Green at the University of Mannheim.

You can create your own "test your understanding answers \<your name\>.txt" files which will be included in the anki cards or use the test() function to test yoursef with n questions. Your inputs will be put into a new answer file by default but you can change this.

If you put answers in a answer file, use the format "\<tut number\> \<question id (e.g. 'j' or '10')\>) \<answer\>"
If you have creates an answer file, feel free to share it here.
